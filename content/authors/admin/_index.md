ðŸ‘‹ I am Alex, a Research Scientist Intern at [FiveAI](https://www.five.ai/research), an autonomous driving company now part of Bosch, where I'm advised by [Dr. Puneet Dokania](https://puneetkdokania.github.io/).

My journey in computer vision began at 16, joining [Rayscape](https://rayscape.ai/), a medical imaging startup. I continued there for two years as a Research Engineer, with a focus on domain generalisation, before moving to [FiveAI](https://www.five.ai/research) where I worked on camera-lidar object inpainting in autonomous driving, advised by [Dr. Romain Mueller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6K_Z_9sAAAAJ&hl=en), as a year-long Research Engineer Intern.

I have recently graduated with a BSc in AI from The University of Manchester. My thesis, supervised by [Prof. Tim Cootes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zhlk0OsAAAAJ&hl=en), focused multimodal counterfactual generation using diffusion models.
