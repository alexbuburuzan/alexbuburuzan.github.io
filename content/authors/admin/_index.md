I am Alex, a Research Scientist Intern at [FiveAI](https://www.five.ai/research) in autonomous driving, advised by [Dr. Puneet Dokania](https://puneetkdokania.github.io/). I am joining University of Oxford as a fully-funded DPhil (PhD) student in [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/students/).

I recently graduated with a BSc in AI from The University of Manchester. I completed my [dissertation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23058) supervised by [Prof. Tim Cootes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zhlk0OsAAAAJ&hl=en) on counterfactual generation using diffusion inpainting models (see [MObI](https://alexbubu.com/mobi) and [AnydoorMed](https://alexbubu.com/anydoormed)).

I began my computer vision journey at 16, at a medical imaging startup. I later continued there as a Research Engineer before joining [FiveAI](https://www.five.ai/research) as a year-long Research Engineer Intern publishing work on multimodal sensor fusion and synthetic data generation for autonomous driving advised by [Dr. Romain Mueller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6K_Z_9sAAAAJ&hl=en).
