abstract: Chest computed tomography (CT) has played a valuable, distinct role in
  the screening, diagnosis, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. The
  quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT has proven to be an important
  predictor of the treatment course and outcome of the patient although it
  remains heavily reliant on the radiologist's subjective perceptions. Here, we
  show that with the adoption of CT for COVID-19 management, a new type of
  psychophysical bias has emerged in radiology. A preliminary survey of 40
  radiologists and a retrospective analysis of CT data from 109 patients from
  two hospitals revealed that radiologists overestimated the percentage of lung
  involvement by 10.23 ± 4.65% and 15.8 ± 6.6%, respectively. In the subsequent
  randomised controlled trial, artificial intelligence (AI) decision support
  reduced the absolute overestimation error (P < 0.001) from 9.5% ± 6.6 (No-AI
  analysis arm, n = 38) to 1.0% ± 5.2 (AI analysis arm, n = 38). These results
  indicate a human perception bias in radiology that has clinically meaningful
  effects on the quantitative analysis of COVID-19 on CT. The objectivity of AI
  was shown to be a valuable complement in mitigating the radiologist’s
  subjectivity, reducing the overestimation tenfold.
